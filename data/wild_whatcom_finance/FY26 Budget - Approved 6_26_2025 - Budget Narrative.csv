Overarching thoughts and context,"There are still guesses for where we will end FY25 including  final summer revenue and individual donations will bring clearer picture to the budget before it's passed by the board in July. Today, review this for big picture questions, concerns, and considerations rather than drilling too deep into line item details (we'll do that later!)"

Income overview,"- This assumes an slight increase in fundraised funds from individual donors. This winter was a particulary bad year (aiming to get back to a more typical winter even with current environment - Sammy shifting energy from grant reporting and grant finances to fundraising
- Currently 0 grants are secured for FY25. Awaiting notice on 2 large grants should find out about $40,000 by end of June. Anything in Blue is good chance, yellow is decent chance, orange is unknown. All grants listed specifically have either been applied to already or we have recieved funding from that entity previously
- Earned revenue increases with slight price increases and increase in # of Nature Preschool spots. Expecting decrease in Exploreres Club and Neighborhood Nature - but mostly offset by price increase and increase in nature preschool. ____ Events and Sponsorships - have been succesfull this year with increasing these funding sources - we know have a much larger network of business with history of funding - anticipating bringing some back in FY 26 who did not give in FY25 and losing some who gave in FY 25"

Contingencies and troubleshooting,"There is uncertainty with income next year due to the current funding environment. Community or school programs could be cut or decreased in January 2026 if revenue is not shaping up as hoped. Our payroll budget includes some part time staff who could be cut/not hired if programs do not fillThis would be the first lever we pull to bring expesnses down. This budget includes significant expense reduction and significant reduction of capacity. On the flipside - if things go well, first priorty will be to bring back gear stipends (about $3,000) and revisit cuts made to non payroll expenses. "

Budget Analysis: 2026 Proposed Budget

This analysis tracks the $289,740 of gross purchasing power managed by the BCCA. While the "Net Budget" (Member Dues) is $282,269, the actual cash flow is higher because it includes income offsets from Parking and Common House donations.

1. The "Big Picture" Flow

Sources (Inflows):

Member Dues: $282,269 (97.4% of total funds).

Parking Income: $6,121 (Garage/Carport fees).

Donations: $1,350 (Specific to Common House usage).

Destinations (Outflows):

Reserves ($117,105): The largest single "department," consuming 40% of the total budget. This is a mandatory savings account for future large-scale repairs (roofs, painting, paving).

Utilities ($86,100): The second largest cost (30%), driven primarily by Natural Gas and Water/Sewer.

Operations ($86,535): The remaining 30% covers all active departments (Maintenance, Finance, Board, CH, Landscaping, Meals).

2. Key Cost Drivers (Why did the budget go up?)

The budget increased by ~8.4% over 2025. The flow diagram highlights exactly where that money is going:

Utilities (+11% increase):

Natural Gas is the main culprit, budgeted at $28,900 (a 19% increase).

Water & Sewer is also up 7% to $27,700.

Maintenance (+11% increase):

A new heavy hitter is "Building Repairs & Unpredictable," which combines for $11,000. This reflects a strategic shift to budget more realistically for aging infrastructure.

Landscaping (+60% increase):

While the dollar amount is small relative to the total, the Tree Trimming line item tripled from $1,000 to **$3,000**, driving nearly the entire department's increase.

Board (+12% increase):

Tech Costs (Internet, Zoom, Website) now total $5,097, nearly half the Board's budget.

Training & Retreats saw a restoration of funding ($2,950 total) after being lower in previous estimates.
